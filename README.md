 # Stress-Level Predictor

I created a model to Predict Stress-Level using different types of regression models:

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Logistic Regression
Among these, the logistic Regression model performed the best, with an accuracy of 85.667% and R2 score of       
0.4585498907600657 and root mean squared error(rmse)value = 0.6658328118479393.
